# Lab 8 - Starter

1. I would run my automated tests for my Recipe project manually running them locally before pushing code because I don't want to compromise any of the user's recipes which they might have saved to localStorage if they weren't connected to th internet. Through local tests, I can make sure the project is working correctly before deploying it to the users.
2. Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? no, that is better suited for unit testing
3. I wouldn't use unit-testing to test the "message" feature because sending a message would probably include many other smaller/individual components such as changing the language, sending different forms of media, links, etc. that might be difficult to singly test in a unit test.
4. I would use unit-testing to test the max message length feature because it is a small scale function that only depends on the number of characters present in the message and thus should be tested in a quick and efficient way like unit testing.

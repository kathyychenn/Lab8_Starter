# Lab 8 - Starter

1. I would run my automated tests for my Recipe project manually running them locally before pushing code because I don't want to compromise any of the user's recipes which they might have saved to localStorage if they weren't connected to th internet. Through local tests, I can make sure the project is working correctly before deploying it to the users.
2. Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? no, that is better suited for unit testing
